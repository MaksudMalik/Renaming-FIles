# Renaming-FIles
Recently I downloaded a course that consists 227 mp4 files. Everything was alright except the names of these mp4 files. They were named in a format of lectureN.mp4 (N=1,2,3...227). This was problematic since one won't know which Lecture is on which topic just by seeing such name and it would be hard to find any specific topic while revising. Luckily there was a text file that had those topic's name in an order coherent with video file's name (Refer to Providedtxt.jpg). So I wrote this script that fetches topic's name from the provided txt file and rename the .mp4 files (refer to output.jpg)
